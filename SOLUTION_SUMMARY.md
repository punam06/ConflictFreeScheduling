# Conflict-Free Scheduling System - Fixed and Working! ✅

## Quick Start Guide

All 4 core features are now working correctly:

### Feature 1: Algorithm Selection ✅
Run individual scheduling algorithms:
```bash
python main.py --algorithm graph-coloring
python main.py --algorithm dynamic-prog
python main.py --algorithm backtracking
python main.py --algorithm genetic
```

### Feature 2: Run All Algorithms ✅
Compare all 4 algorithms:
```bash
python main.py --run-all
```

### Feature 3: Comprehensive Routine ✅
Generate comprehensive routine for all batches:
```bash
python main.py --comprehensive
```

### Feature 4: Academic Routine ✅
Generate enhanced academic routine with proper time slots:
```bash
python main.py --academic-routine
```

## Additional Options

### Batch-specific routines:
```bash
python main.py --algorithm graph-coloring --batch BCSE24 --section A
```

### Basic PDF generation:
```bash
python main.py --basic-pdf --algorithm graph-coloring
```

### Academic PDF with university branding:
```bash
python main.py --academic-pdf --batch BCSE24 --section A
```

## Output Files

All generated files are saved in the `output/` directory:
- **HTML files**: Viewable in any web browser with beautiful, responsive design
- **PDF files**: Professional academic schedules (generated using ReportLab fallback when WeasyPrint GTK libraries aren't available)

## What Was Fixed

1. **Unicode Encoding Issues**: Fixed Windows console encoding problems that prevented the system from running
2. **Database Dependency**: Removed mandatory database requirement for comprehensive routines
3. **PDF Generation**: Improved ReportLab fallback when WeasyPrint isn't available
4. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and graceful fallbacks
5. **WeasyPrint Warning**: More user-friendly messages about GTK library requirements

## System Status: ✅ ALL WORKING

- ✅ Feature 1 (Algorithms): All 4 algorithms working
- ✅ Feature 2 (Run All): Comparison working
- ✅ Feature 3 (Comprehensive): Working with file-based data
- ✅ Feature 4 (Academic): Enhanced routines working
- ✅ PDF Generation: Working with ReportLab
- ✅ HTML Generation: Beautiful, readable output
- ✅ Command Line: All parameters working

## View Generated Files

The HTML files are now readable and contain beautiful, properly formatted schedules. The PDF files are also generated successfully using ReportLab when WeasyPrint GTK libraries are not available on Windows.

## Need Help?

Run any command with `--help` to see all available options:
```bash
python main.py --help
```
