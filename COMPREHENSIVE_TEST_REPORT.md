# Comprehensive Test Report

## Test Execution Summary
**Date:** 22 June 2025  
**Python Version:** 3.13.3  
**Testing Framework:** pytest  

## Test Results Overview

### ✅ **All Tests Passing: 7/7**

| Test Category | Tests | Status |
|---------------|-------|--------|
| Activity Creation | 2 | ✅ PASSED |
| Scheduler Core Functions | 4 | ✅ PASSED |
| File Parser | 1 | ✅ PASSED |

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Activity Management Tests
- **test_activity_creation**: ✅ Validates Activity object creation with proper attributes
- **test_activity_str**: ✅ Verifies string representation of Activity objects

### 2. Scheduler Algorithm Tests
- **test_calculate_total_weight**: ✅ Tests weight calculation for activity sets
- **test_has_conflict**: ✅ Validates conflict detection between activities
- **test_sort_by_end_time**: ✅ Verifies sorting algorithms for end time
- **test_sort_by_start_time**: ✅ Verifies sorting algorithms for start time

### 3. File Processing Tests
- **test_generate_sample_data**: ✅ Tests CSV sample data generation (fixed directory bug)

## Bug Fixes Applied

### FileParser Directory Creation Fix
**Issue:** Empty directory path caused FileNotFoundError in test_generate_sample_data
**Solution:** Added conditional check before creating directories:
```python
dirname = os.path.dirname(filename)
if dirname:  # Only create directory if dirname is not empty
    os.makedirs(dirname, exist_ok=True)
```
